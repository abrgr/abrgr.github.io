In the mist-lost days of yesteryear  
The wolf roamed far and wide  
Man, woman, and child ticked with fear  
For ever the pack lurked nearby  
  
From these fanged marauders did they hide  
Or risk with lance or perchance a rock  
Yet at each encounter there grew in mind  
The certain one-day death of their lot  
  
There arose a cry to build a wall  
To keep the beasts at bay  
Mighty they built it, strong and tall  
And there arose a great hooray  
  
But one held back from joyful thrall  
A man both wizened and grey  
Two sides, he reasoned, has each wall  
One to keep us in while one out to keep they  
  
Despair shed from each and all  
Though life still short and fickle  
But child begot child inside the wall  
These legends ancient and prideful  
  
Over time they found within their fort  
That some grew mean and different  
Until one thought those wolves comport  
Themselves as would befit a dissident  
  
So one brave soul caught up a pup  
From out beyond the wall  
And with it did he breakfast, nurse, and sup  
Till that wolf seemed less scary to all  
  
Then he covered its teeth with caps  
And taught it whom to stalk  
And my how fearful were those chaps  
For who at so fearsome a sight would not balk  
  
More wolves were brought without to in  
And the people grew more docile  
For throughout the streets marched wolfen kin  
Nipping any who grew too hostile  
  
And once again a cheer arose  
For who did not revile  
The beggars and the outcast egos  
Those of weird and different style  
  
And once again one voice was quiet  
His ancestor our old wizened friend  
One day, he thought, might I get  
Too far from normal and who would me defend?  
  
Yet still this man, this derided crackpot  
Was ridiculed as the crowd shouted  
“What silly a worry, who have you shot  
Or which of our just laws have you flouted?”  
  
And on and on and so and so  
The wolves yet grew in power  
Their number swelled and blow by blow  
Over this “protected city” did they tower  
  
And mostly yet, were just their laws  
At least to the minds of those left  
They expanded their walls and trusting in claws  
Were free to get rich and grow heft  
  
So one by one the townspeople consented  
To removing the caps from wolves’ teeth  
More effective they’d be, the gathered wolves presented  
At clearing the worry from the streets  
  
And on and on and so and so  
The space in the walls did shrink  
As pasture they traded along with meadow  
To be safer from that beyond the brink  
  
Faded now their memories gone  
Of the world beyond and within  
Unsteady they walk under threat of braun  
Heads bowed and with nary a grin  
  
For what once was theirs and worth protecting  
Now belonged to the wolves that they trained  
For what’s worth protecting and yours for safekeeping  
Once delegated you’ve lost and shall never regain
