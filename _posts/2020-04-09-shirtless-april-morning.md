Up and out early on a green ice day
Bunny path just about crosses my way
Chirp in the tree, just loud as can be
Not a second of still in this live world you see

Cold skin don't care, can't bother me
Flit here flit there goin tree by tree
Smoke floats can't smell just caught my eye
People all right own worlds just pass on by

Bush droops how can in a scene so fresh
Some droop some perk some got their catch
Just is no ought no yearn for more
Snap fizz scatter now, hear that fire roar

Look all around so much beauty to see
Why do we smile when we catch sighta a tree?
Strong sturdy stoic years rub right by
Keep growing unaware soon touch the sky
