A beacon light  
A young man's glory  
To stand up true for another  
Yet each to live his own story  
  
To give all for an idea  
So convinced that it would  
Lift up all humankind  
If only all understood  
  
With man next to man  
Neither above nor below  
Each to shape his own world  
Free to fail, free to grow  
  
This freedom for sure  
Faced each with disaster  
But reward each would reap  
Others' desire named paymaster  
  
And so, the boy thought,  
The seeds of progress sown  
Enlightenment ever after  
But one way had we grown  
  
To the boy these old giants  
Needed reverence and praise  
For their task demanded courage  
So life is easy these days  
  
Sadly he watched this treasure  
Slowly dismantled and lost  
At the whim of its owners  
To avoid today's slight cost  
  
These cowardly animals  
Knew no higher reason  
Gave consent to the takers  
To plunder and treason  
  
The words most dangerous to man  
So simply pass through their lips  
Now "something must be done!"  
"So it will" the taker quips  
  
The experiment over  
The ratchet now reversed  
Each now marches in chains  
When freedom through veins once coursed  
  
We created an army  
And set them to chase their prey  
Each misguidedly thought  
Was not me but only "they"  
  
"They" grew ever more scary  
And we more rich and fat  
All desire we lost  
To be disturbed by all that  
  
So short the leash of freedom  
That we've left for ourselves  
Its first tug on our neck  
Uncovers long-hidden hells
