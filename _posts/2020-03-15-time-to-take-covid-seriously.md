## It's time to take COVID-19 seriously

I know I've annoyed all of you over the past 2 months warning that this was going to turn into a pandemic. It is now, officially. This was the clear trajectory from looking at the data and linear policy responses to a clearly exponential problem. Just because some are finally taking this seriously does not mean that all is clear. This situation will get much worse before it gets better. We are still acting too slow, testing too little, and living too normally.

### Some thoughts

* Panic vs preparation and precaution. I'm not urging you all to panic and I am not panicking. However, I am taking preparation and precaution **very** seriously. Life is what physicists (and, increasingly, biologists and even the smarter economists) would call non-ergodic. That means it's heavily path-dependent. Once you hit a bad enough event, the possibility of great future events is no longer relevant and all future probabilities basically go to 0. Would you take a bet that could double your net worth 85% of the time but wipe you out completely 15% of the time? Likely not. The bet that we're taking by continuing normalcy throughout COVID has similar odds but significantly worse payouts. 85% of the time you keep what you have and 15% of the time you lose very significantly. The downside is bad enough that it's worth disrupting our lives, worth reducing future earnings by staying at home, worth reducing temporary enjoyment by avoiding others, and worth looking a bit silly to the linearly-thinking sheep who laugh at ahead-of-time preparation (it's not really ahead-of-time anymore anyway) in the face of an exponentially increasing situation. If you order something on Amazon that takes 3 days to get here, there will be twice as many people with COVID by the time it arrives. If you think it's silly to buy today, it will be **significantly** less silly when it arrives.

* We take the convenience of modern society for granted. This isn't about guns but you all know that I believe in owning guns and most of you think that's silly. I own a gun because the time you actually need one is precisely the time when society isn't able to help you. You need your gun when the police are a few minutes away and there's a situation developing over the next few seconds. We're in that situation now. We are trained to defer to authority and let the government do our thinking. The FDA tells us what medicine is safe and effective and the legislature tells us what the bounds of proper social interaction ought to be. These institutions have failed us badly already and deserve no more credence as this pandemic continues. We **must** think for ourselves and take responsibility for our own wellbeing. Government officials care only about reelection. If you act early, you prevent the very panic that you need to justify action. Therefore, expect government to continue to act far too late to be of any use to us. If your city isn't yet on official lockdown, it's not because it's safe, it's because the government is too dumb or too scared to protect you. **YOU** must protect you now. We should all consider ourselves on lockdown now (and should have for a few weeks). Trusting in the governement to protect you now is like taking out insurance from a bankrupt company or, more aptly, taking out fire insurance from a company that keeps all policy premiums in cash in your own house--you can be damn sure that your counterparty will be least able to pay exactly when you most need it. Hospitals are being overrun as we speak **in our areas**. If we continue our lives without **major** disruption, we will end up in hospitals at exactly the time they're least able to help us. **Please stay inside and away from others.**

* The official statistics are wrong. [We have performed](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-testing), to date, a few more tests per capita than India and the Philipines and fewer than Armenia or Lithuania. COVID is already endemic where all of us live. You should not assume that anyone you meet or know doesn't already have it. I am trying not to see the over 60 crowd because I've been in NYC in the past 2 weeks and assume that I have it. The government is trying to quell panic, not to accurately inform those fighting the pandemic. People who need it are still refused tests.

* We do not have enough hospital beds, ICU space, ventilators, or medical staff to properly care for what's to come. This is the whole problem.

### What I'm actually doing

* I have a full freezer and pantry. Aim to have 1 month of food at a minimum. This is not because I think grocery stores will be closed. It's because every interaction you have with others is an opportunity to get infected. There is no sense in not trying to limit these interactions. We love fresh vegetables and fruit. We won't be eating them in a week or two and that is, without a doubt, the best long-term course of action. Your long-term health benefits from fresh fruits and vegetables for the next 1-2 months round to 0.

* I am actually being extra careful for the next few weeks. Hospitals will be overrun and I want to avoid accidents at all costs. Think about this when using a kitchen knife, carrying things down stairs, etc.

* I have [Clorox wipes](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HSC9F2C/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and **I use them**.

* I have plenty of Tylenol. There is [some evidence](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/anti-inflammatory-drugs-may-aggravate-coronavirus-infection) that NSAIDs aggravate COVID. Tylenol should be your go-to fever reducer.

* I have an easy to use [thermometer](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KGOQH8E/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). Fever is a prime COVID symptom and likely the point at which you should talk to a doctor.

* I have a [blood oximeter](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07R3TQF5J/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). Our hospitals will likely be overrun and, while they will do their best, we should take our care into our own hands. The dangerous part of COVID is that it attacks your lungs. This determines how much oxygen is getting pumped through your blood.

* I have [masks](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B085MKZQPB/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). Ideally, you are not going out around others but, if you have to, there will come a time when it would be silly to do so unprotected.

* I am taking care of my immune system with [Emergen-c](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0168JFDFI/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and vitamin D. At the end of the day, if/when we get this, we want a tip-top immune system. There is evidence that vitamin D aids in recovering from respiratory infections.

* I have things to help with cold symptoms (e.g. [cough drops](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BX6TUY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)).
